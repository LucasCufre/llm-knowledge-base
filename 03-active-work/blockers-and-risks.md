## Active Blockers

Blockers are issues currently preventing progress. These require immediate attention.

### Blocker 1: [Blocker Title]
**Status:** =4 Blocking

**Affected Work:** [What's being blocked]
**Identified:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Owner:** [Person responsible for resolution]

**Description:**
[Clear description of what's blocking progress]

**Impact:**
[Specific impact on timeline, deliverables, or team]

**Action Plan:**
- [ ] [Action item 1] - Owner: [Name] - Due: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] [Action item 2] - Owner: [Name] - Due: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] [Action item 3] - Owner: [Name] - Due: YYYY-MM-DD

**Workaround:**
[Temporary workaround while permanent solution is implemented, if any]

**Escalation:**
[Who to escalate to if not resolved by YYYY-MM-DD]

**Identified:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Owner:** [Person responsible for resolution]

**Description:**
[Clear description of what's blocking progress]

## Recently Resolved Blockers

### [Resolved Blocker Title]
**Blocked From:** YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD (X days)
**Impact:** [What was affected]
**Resolution:** [How it was resolved]
**Lessons Learned:** [What we learned]

---

## Active Risks

Risks are potential future issues. We track and mitigate them proactively.

### Risk Scoring
- **Probability:** High (> 50%) / Medium (20-50%) / Low (< 20%)
- **Impact:** High (Major delay/failure) / Medium (Some delay/rework) / Low (Minor impact)
- **Risk Score:** Probability × Impact

### High-Priority Risks (High Probability × High Impact)

#### Risk 1: [Risk Title]
**Risk Score:** =4 High
**Probability:** High / Medium
**Impact:** High
**Identified:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Owner:** [Risk owner]

**Description:**
[What might go wrong]

**Trigger Events:**
[What would indicate this risk is materializing]

**Impact if Realized:**
- [Impact on timeline]
- [Impact on scope]
- [Impact on quality]
- [Impact on team]

**Mitigation Strategy:**
[Actions to reduce probability or impact]
- [ ] [Mitigation action 1] - Owner: [Name] - Due: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] [Mitigation action 2] - Owner: [Name] - Due: YYYY-MM-DD

**Contingency Plan:**
[What we'll do if this risk materializes]

**Related Assumptions:**
[Link to assumptions from constraints-and-assumptions.md if relevant]

#### Risk 2: [Risk Title]
**Risk Score:** =4 High
**Probability:** High / Medium
**Impact:** High
**Identified:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Owner:** [Risk owner]

**Description:**
[What might go wrong]

**Trigger Events:**
[What would indicate this risk is materializing]

**Impact if Realized:**
- [Impact details]

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- [ ] [Mitigation action 1]
- [ ] [Mitigation action 2]

**Contingency Plan:**
[What we'll do if this risk materializes]

---

### Medium-Priority Risks

#### Risk 3: [Risk Title]
**Risk Score:** =á Medium
**Probability:** Medium / Low
**Impact:** High / Medium
**Owner:** [Risk owner]

**Description:** [Brief description]
**Mitigation:** [Brief mitigation strategy]
**Contingency:** [Brief contingency plan]

## Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)

Metrics we track to identify emerging risks:

| KRI | Threshold | Current | Status |
|-----|-----------|---------|--------|
| Velocity variance | > 20% | [%] | =â/=á/=4 |
| Blocker resolution time | > 3 days | [X days] | =â/=á/=4 |
| Open high-severity issues | > 5 | [X] | =â/=á/=4 |
| External dependency delays | > 2 | [X] | =â/=á/=4 |
| Team capacity utilization | > 100% | [%] | =â/=á/=4 |
