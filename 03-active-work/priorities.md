# Current Priorities

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17
**Planning Period:** [Current Sprint/Quarter/Phase]

## Priority Framework

We use the following framework to prioritize work:
- **P0 (Critical):** Blocks launch or causes severe impact; drop everything
- **P1 (High):** Must have for current milestone; schedule immediately
- **P2 (Medium):** Important but not blocking; schedule this sprint/month
- **P3 (Low):** Nice to have; schedule when capacity allows
- **P4 (Backlog):** Future consideration; not scheduled
