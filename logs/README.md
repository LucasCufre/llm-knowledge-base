# Logs Directory

This directory stores maintenance and processing logs generated by the automated workflows.

## Contents

When you run maintenance commands, logs are automatically created here:

- `maintenance-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.log` - Maintenance workflow results
- `processing-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.log` - Document processing results
- `validation-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.log` - Quality validation results

## Gitignore Status

This directory is **gitignored** - logs are local to your workflow and not committed to version control.

## Retention

Consider periodically cleaning old logs:

```bash
# Remove logs older than 30 days
find logs/ -name "*.log" -mtime +30 -delete
```

## Viewing Recent Logs

```bash
# View most recent maintenance log
ls -t logs/maintenance-*.log | head -1 | xargs cat

# View last 50 lines of most recent log
ls -t logs/*.log | head -1 | xargs tail -50
```
